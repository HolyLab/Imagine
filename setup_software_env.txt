To build boost (see their "Getting started")
Open Command Prompt and execute the following:
   cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools
  (or wherever vsvars32.bat is)
  vsvars32.bat
or probably more easily:
  open the Visual Studio tools directory under the Start menu, select "Developer's command prompt"
cd C:\src\boost_1_57_0
bootstrap.bat
.\b2 address-model=64

Compiling qwt:
Open the "Developer's command prompt" as above
cd VC
vcvarsall amd64
cd to qwt directory
qmake (must specify path to qmake executable) as they indicate
