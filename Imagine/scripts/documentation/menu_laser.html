<h1>Laser tab </h1>

<p> The laser module of OCPI-2 has five different wavelengths. We can turn on and off an individual laser by checking the checkbox beside which the wavelength is labled. The power of the laser can be also adjusted with slide bars and spinboxes. During the laser setting, we need to open the main laser shutter by clicking the <a href="main_menu.html#hardware">"Open Shutter" button</a> in the main menu. If we use <a href="waveform_ctrl_mode.html">waveform control mode</a>, we can control the each shutters of the five individual wavelengths differently. </p><br>
