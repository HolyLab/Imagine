<ul>
<li> Display Full Image : this menu make the camera ROI as full resion.</li>
<li> No Auto Scale : does not apply auto scale to the intensity of the captured images in displaying them.</li>
<li> Auto Scale On First Frame : applies auto scale to the first frame image of a stack. And following frames are scaled with the scale factor of the first frame of the stack which they are belonged.</li>
<li> Auto Scale On All Frames : apllies auto scale to the every frame of the capture images.</li>
<li> Manual : enables users to set the scale manually. Intensity from "min" value and "max" value will be scaled to 0 to 255. If we overlap the camera1 iamge with the camera2 iamge, "cam2 min" and "cam2 max" can be used to set the minimum and maximum intensity value of the camera2 image. </li>
<li> Colorize Saturated Pixels : enables display to indicate the saturated pixel with some colors. Blue color pixels indicates pixels which have minus intensity value after scaling. Red is for pixels having intensity over 256.</li>
<li> Flicker control : reduces the flicker caused by abnormal black frames between normal frames. </li>
</ul>
